    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
     team3[2] = 'ruaway';
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'tara ra ra raaa';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 
    team4[3] = 'heee haaaa'; 

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
     const captain = person;
     captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person ,{number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //for deep levels search deep clone or 
  const cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))  ;
